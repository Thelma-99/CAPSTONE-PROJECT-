# CAPSTONE-PROJECT-
Introduction
Data analysis plays a pivotal role in transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive decision-making and strategy. This project focuses on evaluating retail sales performance by analyzing product, regional, and monthly trends. By utilizing Excel for data exploration, SQL for data extraction, and Power BI for visualization, the project will culminate in an interactive dashboard that highlights key insights into sales performance.
Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate the sales performance of a retail store by analyzing key metrics and insights within the sales data. The analysis will focus on identifying the top-selling products, evaluating regional performance, and exploring monthly sales trends. The results will be presented in an interactive Power BI dashboard, designed to deliver clear and actionable insights into the store’s performance. The dataset includes sales transactions across different product categories, regions, and time periods, with metrics such as total revenue, sales volume, and customer data for KPI analysis. Initial exploration in Excel will leverage pivot tables to calculate metrics like average sales per product and regional revenue, while SQL will be used
for more complex queries, such as identifying top products, assessing regional sales contributions, and tracking monthly sales trends.
